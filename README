Suggested design changes: 
1. Make a separate Dictionary class which stores words from a dictionary file in an ArrayList. An instance of this class
   then be used by both the SpellChecker and WordRecommender class, rather than having to repeat the code in both these classes.
2. The getWordSuggestions method and getWordsWithCommonLetters both compare a given word with words in the dictionary. 
   Rather than repeating code with similar functionality, we can make one helper method that is used by both methods.
